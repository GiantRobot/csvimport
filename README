Drupal 8 Batch Process CSV
--

This is an example module for Drupal which uses file upload and Batch API to
import a CSV file. It generates a batch and runs it. The batch iterates
through each line of the CSV (except the first) and does ... nothing, except
for filling the progress bar. Sample code to import CSV to node included.

The basic idea is that if you're writing a CSV importer for Drupal,
maybe you can start here and save a lot of time.
